# OOF-validation
OOF validation using Kfold CV


Project Overview:

  *  This project explores the concept of stacked meta-learning, where multiple base models are trained and their predictions are combined to form a more accurate meta-model.
  * It utilizes Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors as base models and builds a Logistic Regression meta-model on their predictions.
  * The code demonstrates cross-validation for model evaluations and accuracy comparisons.

Code Breakdown:

1. Data Generation and Split:

  - Generates a synthetic dataset using make_blobs with two clusters and 100 features.
  - Splits the data into training, validation, and test sets for model training and evaluation.
    
2. Base Model Training and Predictions:

  - Implements a KFold cross-validation loop for training and prediction with both base models (Decision Tree and KNN).
  - Stores the predictions of each base model for future meta-model training.
    
3. Meta-Dataset Creation:

  - Defines a function create_meta_dataset that horizontally stacks the original features with the base model predictions.
  - This meta-dataset combines the information learned by the base models into a single feature space.
    
4. Meta-Model Training and Evaluation:

  - Trains a Logistic Regression model as the meta-model on the meta-dataset created from base predictions.
  - Evaluates the meta-model accuracy on the validation set using the accuracy_score metric.
    
 5. Stacking Prediction:

  - Defines a function stack_prediction that takes the base models and the meta-model as inputs.
  - It generates predictions for the validation set using the base models and then feeds them to the meta-model for final predictions.

6. Results and Comparison:

  - Prints the accuracy scores of both base models on the validation set.
  - Compares the meta-model accuracy with the individual base model accuracies, demonstrating the potential performance improvement through stacking.

Key Takeaways:

  - Stacked meta-learning can potentially improve classification accuracy by combining the strengths of individual base models.
  - This code provides a basic example of implementing stacked meta-learning with Scikit-Learn.
